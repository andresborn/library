# Library Project

#### Part of TOP's JS course

This lesson was oriented on Objects and Constructors. I learned how objects work, how to use constructors to define new objects and how to change them with inputs from the DOM.

#### We also learned:

- localStorage
- How forms work
- How to receive information inputs
- More efficient ways to do Dom manipulation using `innerHTML`
- Event delegation for manipulating dynamically generated objects

Special mention to WesBos's JS30 localStorage lesson. This video cleared many doubts.
